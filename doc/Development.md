# Development Guide

## Architecture

`Source code` ==Parser=> `Type definition` + `unresolved types` ==Resolver=> `Type definition` + `resolved types` ==Writer=> `target schema/language`

Internal types also have javadoc for more information.
#### Project structure
* `annotation` contains the annotation type `@SharedType` as client code compile-time dependency.
* `processor` contains annotation processor logic, put on client's annotation processing path.
* `it` contains integration tests, which do metadata verification by deserializing metadata objects.
    * `java8` contains major types for tests.
    * `java17` uses symlink to reuse types in `java8` then does more type checks, e.g. for Java `record`.
* `client-test` contains target languages' tests respectively against generated code.

Why symlinks are used to share code between modules?
1. To reduce modules counts and dependencies.
2. `@SharedType` is only retained in source code level.

## Setup
**Linux is assumed**. If you use Windows, you can use WSL with a remotely connected IDE. Windows 11 supports GUI app inside WSL.

Setup Java env vars (>= Java17 for development), configure `JAVA17_HOME` to point to your Java installation:
```bash
. setenv
```
Optionally mount tmpfs to save your disk by:
```bash
./mount-tmpfs.sh
```
## Development
### Run test
If you encounter compilation problems with your IDE, delegate compilation to maven.
Before run test in IDE/individual module, run `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests` to build dependency classes.
#### E.g. run integration test locally:
```bash
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -q && ./mvnw test -pl it/java17 -pl it/java8
```
#### Run local verification with all java tests:
```bash
./mvnw verify
```
#### Verify JDK8 compatibility locally:
Setup `JAVA8_HOME` to point to your Java8 installation. Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
. setenv 8
./mvnw verify -pl it/java8
```
#### Run client tests locally:
Client tests are run in target languages in respective dir inside `./client-test`. They do basic type checking.
* Typescript. `. setenv && npm i && npm run test`
#### Misc:
Style check:
```bash
./mvnw editorconfig:check
```
Debug annotation processor by run maven build:
```bash
./mvnd <your args goes here>
```
Then attach your debugger on it.

## Coding Style Guide / Keep it simple
1. since annotation processing is one shot execution, JIT is not likely to optimize the code. So prefer plain loop than long calling stacks like Stream chains.
2. no adding dependencies without strong justification.
3. Lombok is used in this project, but do not abuse. Only use it to replace unavoidable boilerplate code, and not to increase the bytecode size.
Do not use compile time heavy annotation like `lombok.val`.
